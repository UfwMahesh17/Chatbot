When Cloud Migration?


Cloud migration becomes necessary when your current infrastructure struggles to meet business demands, such as needing enhanced scalability to handle growth, requiring greater agility to respond to market changes, or aiming to reduce capital expenditure on aging hardware. 
Other triggers include the end-of-support for critical on-premises systems, the desire to leverage advanced cloud-native services (like AI/ML), improve disaster recovery capabilities, or achieve better global reach and performance. 
If operational inefficiencies, high maintenance costs, or limitations in innovation are holding you back, it’s time to consider the cloud.
