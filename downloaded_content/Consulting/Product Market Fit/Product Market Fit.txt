Why Product Market Fit?
Achieving product-market fit is fundamental to business survival and scaling effectively. 
Without it, companies launch offerings into an indifferent market, leading to wasted resources, anemic sales, and customer churn. 
Neglecting this critical alignment means marketing becomes an expensive "push" rather than a natural "pull". Products fail not because they aren't good, but because they don't solve a strong market need for a well-defined audience..
Benefits of Product Market Fit
1. Explosive Organic Growth:

Products deeply aligned with market needs often experience rapid, word-of-mouth adoption, significantly reducing customer acquisition costs and fueling sustainable expansion.
2. Unwavering Customer Loyalty:
